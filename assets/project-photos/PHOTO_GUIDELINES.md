# Rittenworx Photo Optimization Guidelines

## 📸 Why This Matters for SEO
Google can't "see" images like humans do. It relies on **file names** and **metadata** to understand what the photo is. 
*   **Good Name:** `drywall-repair-madison-al-before.jpg` (Google knows: Service + City + Context)
*   **Bad Name:** `IMG_9023.jpg` (Google knows: Nothing)

## 📂 Folder Structure
We have created dedicated folders for your top revenue services. Please sort photos accordingly:
*   `\drywall`
*   `\painting`
*   `\flooring`
*   `\carpentry`
*   `\gutters`

## 🏷️ Naming Convention (The Golden Rule)
Please rename files **before** uploading them if possible. Use this format:
`[service]-[city]-al-[before/after].jpg`

**Examples:**
*   **Drywall in Huntsville:** `drywall-patch-huntsville-al-after.jpg`
*   **Deck in Athens:** `deck-repair-athens-al-before.jpg`
*   **Painting in Madison:** `interior-painting-madison-al-living-room.jpg`

## ✅ Photo Quality Checklist
1.  **Bright & Clear:** Ensure the area is well-lit.
2.  **Clean Lens:** Wipe the phone camera lens to avoid "foggy" photos.
3.  **Wide Angles:** Show enough of the room so customers verify the context.
4.  **No People:** Avoid showing faces key identifiers unless authorized.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Once photos are dropped here:
1.  **Notify the Team.**
2.  **We will geotag them** (add invisible GPS data).
3.  **We will upload them** to the Google Business Profile.
